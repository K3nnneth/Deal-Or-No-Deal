# Deal-Or-No-Deal

For this project, I created a fully-functioning Deal or No Deal game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This game works just like the original game show where users are able to select their own case before selecting cases to earn money. I was inspired to make this game because my friends and I had a lot of fun playing the arcade version at a bowling alley. It was something interesting that I wanted to create and I also wanted to practice my frontend skills with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
